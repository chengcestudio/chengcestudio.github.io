Sandro Chia Born in Florence (20 April 1946), Italy, was one of the foremost artists during the resurgent interest in painting in the 1980s. He established himself as a major artist of the movement in Italian figurative painting known as the Transavanguardia, a Neo-Expressionist movement that sought to re-emphasize color and representation in reaction to the Conceptual Art of the times. His works were exhibited in many of the most important museums and galleries of the world, and featured in almost every major museum exhibition benchmarking that era including Zeitgeist in 1982. In a career spanning over four decades, some of the exhibition milestones include the Biennale of Paris, San Paolo and three different iterations of the Venice Biennale.
